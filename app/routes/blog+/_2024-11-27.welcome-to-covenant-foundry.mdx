Hi! I'm Jon. I'm a Christian, husband, father of two, deacon, software developer, and entrepreneur. Since COVID hit five years ago, I've been building software remotely for clients ranging from government agencies to ecommerce to ed-tech. Now, I have lofty dreams of launching tech startups.

Building a startup successfully almost always requires finding at least one good partner. There are a few rare people who are good at everything, but I'm not one of them!

I live in a small town in Ohio, in an area dominated mostly by agriculture and manufacturing. We have close ties with our church, community, and nearby family - connections we value. But we don't have the same concentrations of enthusiastic founders that a larger metropolitan area might.

Rather than picking up and moving my family, I aim to leverage the technology God has given us to have the best of both worlds - deep local roots as well as meaningful remote connections with other Christian founders.

At Covenant Foundry, we're building a community where Christian entrepreneurs can meet, collaborate, and build something great together.

Want to be part of it?
